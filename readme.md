# Crime Influenced Walking/Biking App

A walking or biking application that weighs high crime areas lower to keep the user in safer areas.

# TODO (In somewhat order...):
1. Use openstreet maps to determine closest node to a lat and lon point.
2. Django hosted page to show map live.
3. Use webpage clicking interaction to choose nodes A and B, and return a route
4. Implement crime data weighting for the route.
5. Fine tune route.
6. Create better UI
7. Implement searching an address -> node -> route? --- Maybe ---
8. Expand to nearby areas, as long as data is present.
9. Research what other map applications use? Osm? Google? Hodge Podge?
